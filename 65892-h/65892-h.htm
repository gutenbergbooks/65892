<blockquote>
<p class="b smaller">In this Mansion, which became his home when he married Mary
Custis, Robert E. Lee wrote his resignation from the United States
Army in April 1861, to join the cause of Virginia and the South.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lee Mansion National Memorial,
or Arlington House, as it was formerly
known, distinctive through its associations
with the families of Custis, Washington,
and Lee, stands within the Nation&rsquo;s most
famous cemetery on the Virginia side of
the Potomac opposite Washington. This
house of the foster son of the First President
was for years the treasury of both the
Washington heirlooms and the Washington
tradition. Here Robert E. Lee, a
young lieutenant in the U. S. Army, and
Mary Custis, the great-granddaughter of
Martha Washington, were married and
reared a family. Here, also, Col. Robert E.
Lee, torn between devotion to his country
and to his native State, made his fateful
decision, the substance of which he had
written to his son a few months before: &ldquo;It
is the principle I contend for.... But I
can anticipate no greater calamity for the
country than a dissolution of the Union....
Still, a Union that can only be maintained
by swords and bayonets ... has no charm
for me. I shall mourn for my country and
for the welfare and progress of mankind.
If the Union is dissolved ... I shall return
to my native State ... and save in
defence will draw my sword on none.&rdquo;
Today Arlington House, furnished with
appointments of its early period, preserves
for posterity the atmosphere of gracious
living, typical of a romantic age of American
history.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>Early History</i></span></h2>
<p>George Washington Parke Custis, builder
of Arlington House, was the grandson of
Martha Washington and the foster son of
George Washington. When Martha Dandridge
Custis became the wife of Col.
George Washington she was a widow with
two children, Martha Parke Custis and
John Parke Custis. Martha Parke Custis
died in her teens without having been
married, but John Parke Custis married
Eleanor Calvert of Maryland in 1774, and
upon his death at the close of the Revolutionary
War left four children. The death
of John Parke Custis was a shock, not only
to his mother, Mrs. Washington, but to
General Washington as well, as he is reported
to have remarked to the grieving
mother at the deathbed, &ldquo;I adopt the two
youngest children as my own.&rdquo; Their
names were Eleanor Parke Custis (Nellie)
and George Washington Parke Custis.
They were reared at Mount Vernon and
are often referred to as the &ldquo;Children of
Mount Vernon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1802, the year his grandmother, Mrs.
Washington, died, George Washington
Parke Custis began building Arlington
House on the estate of 1,100 acres which
his father had purchased from the Alexander
family in 1778. He named the
estate &ldquo;Arlington&rdquo; and the home &ldquo;Arlington
House&rdquo; in honor of the ancestral homestead
of the Custis family on the Eastern
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
Shore of Virginia. The house was to receive
the legacy of his grandmother&mdash;furniture
and pictures, plate and china
from Mount Vernon, and more precious
still, personal effects of Washington. Two
years later, at the age of 23, he was married
to Mary Lee Fitzhugh of Chatham.</p>

<p class="pcap">Portrait of Robert E. Lee, about 1850
<br />(G. Louvrie)</p>
</div>
<p>It is believed that Mr. Custis designed
and supervised the original building and
that its remodeling about 1820 was under
the direction of the architect, George Hadfield.
The foundation stone and timber
came from the estate. The bricks with
which the house was built were burned
from native clay by slaves.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Arlington</i></span></h2>
<p>The extent of the front of the Mansion,
with its two wings, is 140 feet. The wings
are identical, except that in the north wing
the space corresponding to the state dining
room in the south wing was divided into
small rooms for the temporary accommodation
of Mr. and Mrs. Custis while the
house was being built and was never
changed. The central portion is divided
by a wide central hall. A large formal
drawing room with two fine marble fireplaces
lies south of this hall, while to the
north of it can be seen the family dining
room and family parlor separated by a
north and south partition broken by three
graceful arches. The second story is also
divided by a central hall on either side of
which there are two bedrooms and accompanying
dressing rooms. A small room
used as a linen closet is at the end of this
hall. The third floor was used only for
storage purposes and remained an unfinished
attic. The grand portico facing the
Potomac, with its eight massive Doric columns,
was modeled after the Temple of
Theseus at Athens. At the rear, two outhouses
used as servants&rsquo; quarters, smokehouse,
workroom, and summer kitchen
form a courtyard.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>General Lafayette Visits Arlington</i></span></h2>
<p>One of the most pleasant incidents in the
history of Arlington House was the visit in
1824 of General Lafayette, whose reverence
for the memory of Washington
matched that of his host. It is related that
on entering he commented on the iron lantern
in the hall, which he remembered at
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
Mount Vernon. The view from the portico
he pronounced unrivaled, entreating
Mrs. Custis never to sacrifice any of the
fine trees. General Lafayette returned
again to Arlington House in 1825 as the
guest of the Custises for several weeks.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>Lt. Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s Marriage</i></span></h2>
<p>On June 30, 1831, Mary Ann Randolph
Custis, only child of the Custis family at
Arlington, became the wife of Robert E.
Lee, a young lieutenant in the U. S. Army,
just 2 years out of West Point. The ceremony
took place under a floral bell hung
in the archway between the family dining
room and parlor. The wedding party remained
at Arlington in festivity and merriment
until July 5, when the groom&rsquo;s fellow
officers, their leaves ending, were forced to
say good-by. Some of the bridesmaids
lingered until the end of the week.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>Mrs. Lee Inherits Arlington</i></span></h2>
<p>Much of Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s married life was
spent at the home of her girlhood, sometimes
with her husband, sometimes awaiting
his return from the Mexican War, or
other distant tours of duty. Six of the
seven Lee children were born here. By
the will of George Washington Parke Custis,
who died in 1857, the estate of Arlington
was bequeathed to his daughter for
her lifetime, and afterward to his eldest
grandson and namesake, George Washington
Custis Lee.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p02c.jpg" alt="" width="1138" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">The state drawing room</p>
</div>
<p>Never a thrifty farmer and an easygoing
master, requiring little of his slaves, Mr.
Custis&rsquo; death found the Arlington plantation
sadly run down. Robert E. Lee as
executor felt that his presence at Arlington
was necessary if he was to give proper
attention to the estate. He, therefore, obtained
extended leave and settled down to
the life of a farmer. Three years elapsed
before he rejoined his regiment. During
this period, the traditions of Arlington
House were maintained. Situated on the
main-traveled road from the South, Arlington
was a favorite stopping place for relatives
and friends. Its hospitable doors
were always open to such guests.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>The Lees Leave Arlington</i></span></h2>
<p>Following the news of the secession of
Virginia, news which he had hoped never
to hear, Colonel Lee, on April 20, 1861,
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
resigned his commission in the U. S. Army.
Monday morning, April 22, at the request
of the Governor of Virginia, he departed
for Richmond. Mrs. Lee remained at
Arlington engaged in the work of dismantling
her home and sending family possessions
to a place of safety. She had not
completed this task, when, on May 24, the
seizure of lands between Washington and
Alexandria by Federal troops caused her
to abandon everything. The remaining
family possessions were later taken from
Arlington and locked up in the old Patent
Office in Washington, but not before many
things, including some of the Mount Vernon
heirlooms, had been carried away.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>The United States Acquires Arlington</i></span></h2>
<p>Situated on the line of fortifications
guarding Washington, Arlington estate
soon became an armed camp, and, after
the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861,
was used as a field hospital. In 1864, at a
tax sale, the United States acquired title to
Arlington for $26,800. Upon the death of
Mrs. Lee in 1873&mdash;General Lee having
died in 1870&mdash;Custis Lee took steps to recover
his property, as under the will of his
grandfather, George Washington Parke
Custis, he became entitled to Arlington.
His case was carried to the United States
Supreme Court, where a decision favorable
to Mr. Lee was obtained. He then consented
to give the United States a clear
title to the property for $150,000, and Congress
in 1883 appropriated the necessary
funds.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>Arlington House Restored</i></span></h2>
<p>For years after the war, the Mansion
stood an empty shell&mdash;an office for the
superintendent of the cemetery and a place
for his tools. By act of Congress, approved
March 4, 1925, the Secretary of
War was empowered to undertake the
restoration of Arlington House to the condition
in which it existed prior to the War
Between the States and to procure for it,
when possible, furniture known to have
been in the Mansion, replicas of that furniture,
or other pieces of a style suitable to
the first half of the nineteenth century.
Some of the historical originals have been
returned, and for those that could not be
obtained similar period pieces and a few
copies have been substituted. In 1933
Arlington House was transferred from the
War Department to the Department of the
Interior.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>Visitor Service and Facilities</i></span></h2>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
